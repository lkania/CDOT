To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that older versions of RStudio (versions lower than 1.3) may not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.
 
2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 
 
3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.

This form documents the artifacts associated with the article (i.e., the data
and code supporting the computational findings) and describes how to reproduce
the findings.

# Part 1: Data

  used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their
  code).

<!--
If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the Code section. Otherwise, continue.
-->

- [x] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to
  and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->

<!--
In the Large Hadron Collider, two protons or
heavy ions are accelerated in opposite directions and made to collide within
underground detectors. When a collision
occurs, called an event, the kinetic energy of the particles transforms into
mass, creating new
particles. Most collisions
are considered uninteresting, and are called background
events. However, some collisions might create the theorized fundamental
particles, called signal events. This repository contains
the background and signal events related to two experiments: the high-momentum
W-boson production, see section 1 of the paper, and high-mass resonance
production, see appendix A.1 of the supplementary material.
-->

Two high-energy particle physics data sets related to the detection of
high-$p_T$ W bosons (called W-Tagging), and the detection of exotic high-mass
resonance events (called 3b/4b) are analyzed in the article.
The data contain information about the jets produced in different collision
events
for background and signal events.
These include the invariant mass variable (`mass` for W-tagging, `m4j` for
3b/4b) and
a variable for whether an event is a background or a signal event
(`label` for W-tagging -- `0`: signal, `1`: background, `Class` for 3b/4b).
Further, the W-tagging data include jet-substructure variables
and the 3b/4b data include kinematic variables for the jets.

Otherwise, see the *Non-publicly available data* section, below.

### Publicly available data

- [ ] Data are available online at:

- [x] Data are available as part of the paper’s supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described
  here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described
  here:

<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.
-->

All data is publicly available.
